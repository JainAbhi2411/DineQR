# How to Enable Portions for Menu Items

## Overview
This guide explains how restaurant owners can enable half/full portion options for their menu items, allowing customers to choose their preferred serving size.

---

## 🎯 What Are Portions?

Portions allow customers to order different serving sizes of the same dish:
- **Full Portion**: Standard serving size at full price
- **Half Portion**: Smaller serving at half the price

### Common Use Cases
- **Biryani**: Full plate ($18) or Half plate ($9)
- **Curry Dishes**: Full serving or Half serving
- **Appetizers**: Regular or Small portion
- **Desserts**: Full or Half portion

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before enabling portions, ensure:
1. You have access to the restaurant owner dashboard
2. You have menu items already created
3. You understand your pricing strategy

---

## 🚀 Method 1: Enable via Dashboard (Recommended)

### Step 1: Navigate to Menu Management
```
Dashboard → Menu Management → Menu Items
```

### Step 2: Edit Menu Item
1. Find the item you want to enable portions for
2. Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon)
3. Scroll to the "Portion Settings" section

### Step 3: Enable Portions
1. Toggle the "Enable Portions" switch to ON
2. The system will automatically:
   - Set Full portion price = Base price
   - Set Half portion price = Base price ÷ 2

### Step 4: Save Changes
1. Click "Save" or "Update Item"
2. The item now supports portion selection

---

## 💻 Method 2: Enable via Database (Advanced)

### Using SQL
```sql
-- Enable portions for a specific item
UPDATE menu_items
SET has_portions = true
WHERE id = 'your-item-id';

-- Enable portions for all items in a category
UPDATE menu_items
SET has_portions = true
WHERE category_id = 'your-category-id';

-- Enable portions for all main course items
UPDATE menu_items
SET has_portions = true
WHERE category_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM menu_categories 
  WHERE name ILIKE '%main%' OR name ILIKE '%curry%'
);
```

### Using Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Table Editor
3. Select `menu_items` table
4. Find your item
5. Set `has_portions` column to `true`
6. Click Save

---

## 🎨 Method 3: Using Variants (Advanced Pricing)

For more control over pricing, use variants instead:

### Example: Custom Portion Pricing
```json
{
  "has_portions": false,
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "Half",
      "price": 9.99,
      "description": "Perfect for one person"
    },
    {
      "name": "Full",
      "price": 17.99,
      "description": "Serves 2 people"
    },
    {
      "name": "Family",
      "price": 32.99,
      "description": "Serves 4-5 people"
    }
  ]
}
```

### When to Use Variants
- ✅ Non-standard pricing (not exactly half)
- ✅ More than 2 portion sizes
- ✅ Different descriptions for each size
- ✅ Special pricing strategies

### When to Use has_portions
- ✅ Simple half/full split
- ✅ Automatic half-price calculation
- ✅ Standard portion sizes
- ✅ Quick setup

---

## 📊 Pricing Examples

### Example 1: Simple Half/Full
```
Item: Chicken Biryani
Base Price: $18.00
has_portions: true

Result:
- Full: $18.00 (base price)
- Half: $9.00 (automatic calculation)
```

### Example 2: Custom Variants
```
Item: Margherita Pizza
Base Price: $18.00
has_portions: false
variants: [
  {"name": "Small (8\")", "price": 12.00},
  {"name": "Medium (12\")", "price": 18.00},
  {"name": "Large (16\")", "price": 24.00}
]

Result:
- Small: $12.00
- Medium: $18.00
- Large: $24.00
```

### Example 3: Both Variants and Portions
```
Item: Butter Chicken
Base Price: $16.00
has_portions: true
variants: [
  {"name": "Regular", "price": 16.00},
  {"name": "Extra Spicy", "price": 17.00}
]

Result:
Regular:
- Full: $16.00
- Half: $8.00

Extra Spicy:
- Full: $17.00
- Half: $8.50
```

## 📊 Analytics & Reporting

### Track Portion Preferences
```sql
-- See which portions are most popular
SELECT 
  portion_size,
  COUNT(*) as order_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*)::numeric / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () * 100, 2) as percentage
FROM order_items
WHERE menu_item_id = 'your-item-id'
  AND portion_size IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY portion_size
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

### Example Output
```
portion_size | order_count | percentage
-------------+-------------+-----------
Full         | 150         | 65.22
Half         | 80          | 34.78
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Seasonal Portions
Enable portions during lunch hours when customers want smaller servings:
```sql
-- Can be automated with a scheduled job
UPDATE menu_items
SET has_portions = true
WHERE category_id IN (SELECT id FROM menu_categories WHERE name = 'Lunch Specials');
```

### Tip 2: Combo with Promotions
Offer discounts on full portions:
```sql
-- Create promotion for full portions
INSERT INTO promotions (restaurant_id, title, discount_type, discount_value)
VALUES ('your-restaurant-id', 'Full Portion Special', 'percentage', 10);
```

### Tip 3: Kitchen Display
Ensure kitchen staff can see portion size:
