## 🔄 Automatic Compression

### What Happens When Your Image is Too Large?

If you upload an image larger than 1MB, our system automatically:

1. **Compresses** it to a smaller size
2. **Converts** it to WEBP format (better quality, smaller size)
3. **Resizes** it to fit perfectly on the menu
4. **Notifies** you of the compression

**You'll see a message like**:
```
✅ Success
Image uploaded and compressed from 2048KB to 856KB
```

**Don't worry!** The image will still look great - we use smart compression that maintains quality.
